This project is a character recognition project. It collects images of characters and tries to identify which characters from what source are in them. 

fictional_character_singles.ipynb is for single chracters, while fictional_characters.ipynb is for multiple in each image.

The problem with singles is that a lot of the source images are of more than one character together, rather than a standalone.
